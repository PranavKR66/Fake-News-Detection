# Fake-News-Detection

• Collected and transformed text data from multiple sources into a single usable dataframe in pandas using python
• Performed exploratory data analysis on a data set consisting of 40,000 rows. Preprocessed the data by removing special characters, numbers and stop words
• Transformed the data into unigrams, bigrams, and term frequency-Inverse Document Frequency formats
• Implemented machine learning algorithms like Random Forests, Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression
• Used Grid Search and k-fold cross-validation to tune the hyper-parameters in order to optimize the recall of the models. Made predictions with f1 and accuracy values of around 99 percent.
